# Running Tests

## Unit Tests

```shell
vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite unit
```

## Integration Tests

To run the integration tests, you need a local setup of the CVE Service.
It is provided on the CVE Project's repository as a Docker setup.

Clone that repository and spin up the containers as described int the documentation.

Once the containers are up and running, you can start the integration tests.

```shell
vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite integration
```
